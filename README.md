# Herbarium Plant Biodiversity Project

## Project Overview

This web application is a comprehensive platform developed for the COS30020 Web Application Development course at Swinburne University of Technology. The project aims to contribute to plant biodiversity research by creating a portal for participants to upload and explore plant specimens.

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- Bootstrap CSS
- MySQL
- Teachable Machine (Machine Learning)

## Key Features

### 1. User Management

- User registration and authentication
- Profile creation and management
- Secure login system

### 2. Plant Classification

- Educational resources on plant taxonomy
- Information about plant families, genus, and species

### 3. Plant Identification System üåøüîç

#### Teachable Machine Integration

The project's standout feature is the plant identification system powered by Google's Teachable Machine.

**Key Highlights:**

- Machine learning model trained on diverse plant images
- Automatic plant species recognition
- Provides:
  - Scientific plant name
  - Common name
  - Corresponding herbarium specimen images
  - Downloadable plant description (PDF)

#### Model Training Process

1. Collected diverse plant images
2. Used Teachable Machine to train the classification model
3. Integrated the trained model into the web application
4. Implemented image upload and classification functionality

### 4. Contribution Portal

- Users can upload:
  - Fresh leaf images
  - Herbarium specimen images
  - Detailed plant information

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up XAMPP
3. Configure MySQL database
4. Import Teachable Machine model
5. Run the application

## Future Enhancements

- Expand plant recognition database
- Improve machine learning model accuracy
- Add more detailed botanical information
